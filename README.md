# halp's Advanced VEX Robotics Programming Guide

### Disclaimer:

This guide is not for the faint of heart or those new to programming for VEX Robotics. If you are looking for a copy-paste solution, you are in the wrong place. However, if you want highly performant code that you understand and can document, this is the place for you.

All of the code in this guide is written in rust and is used with the vexide v5 rust framework. However, minimal understanding of rust is required to follow along.

## How to use this guide effectively

1. **Read Thoroughly**: Read each section and its corresponding code (possibly multiple times) until you fully understand not just how to implement it, but why it works.
2. **Don't throw it into AI**: It's tempting to just take one of these articles and say "copilot, implement this in c++ for me." Don't do that.
3. **Implement as you go**: After reading each section, implement the code into your own codebase. This helps you solidify your understanding of the concept.
